## Description
Have you gone to a beach on weekends and struggled to get a parking spot or 
had trouble in finding a place to park near big events like the 4th of July firework ? 
Or do you wish to host a swimming pool party but are restriced because you 
don't have swimming pool in your house? 

‘Rent My Space’ app can provide solutions to these problems. This app provides a 
listing of all the properties for renters to book. The renters can book the 
property for using the driveway, backyard swimming pool or other spaces.

## Users 
There are 2 types of users for this app 1) property owners and 2) renters
The property owners will provide information about their property that they 
plan to rent through a form input. The property will then be listed on the app. 
The renter can book the property based on the availability. The renter can  make 
payments to the owner for using the property.

renters). The CRUD operations can be performed through the end points of the REST API. An external google API is accessed to get the maps of the property.
